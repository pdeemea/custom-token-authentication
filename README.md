# custom-token-authentication
Proof of Concept to demonstrate how to implement custom token authentication within a Spring/Spring Boot application.

Goals:

1. Demonstrate how to add custom token authentication. The recommended way is to add an authentication endpoint, i.e. a `@Controller`, and the authentication thru that controller. This is contrary to standard off-the-shelf authentication methods like `BasicAuthenticationFilter` which are implemented as Filters and are added to the Security filter chain. It is quite straightforward to do it.
2. Demonstrate how to add a pre-authentication filter that allows a developer to run their applications locally without having to login every time they restart their apps. This filter, on the other hand, is added as a Security Filter and it works pretty much as the `AnonymousAuthenticationFilter`. 
I think another way to achieve this goal, but i have not tried it yet, is to rely on BasicAuthenticationFilter and configure the roles for the default user in the `application.yml` `security.rule.role: ADMIN` and rely on the browser to cache your userÂ´s credentials. We would only have to activate the basic Authentication. It is worth trying this one.

To demonstrate goal 1 you just need to run the app as it is and go to localhost:8083/. This is the public landing page. If you try to access /home you will be redirected back to the landing page. There are a few links to demonstrate login, logout, allowed operations, not allowed operations and error handling of unexpected errors.
To demonstrate goal 2 you need to activate the profile `preAuth` (In STS, type in preAuth in the Profile field under Run Configurations). The user, credential and roles are read from the `application.yml`.
